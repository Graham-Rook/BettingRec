MarketManager class Code Review
****************
1. String comparisons are an issue, TRIM and ToUpper will be necessary.
2. Use Constants for hard coded values.
3. remove unecessary iterations.
4. Exception being thrown include some information of why the exception, add constants for some exception messages
5. remove uncessary else - place return inside the conditions
6. remove uncessary variable declaration at the top of the class
7. Make it implent an interface so that it can be more generic if necessary, this will also allow for testing abstractions such as mocking
8. Add switch statement, remove if statements to cater for more possible sport options
9. No Code coverage - implement unit tests for success and fail paths
